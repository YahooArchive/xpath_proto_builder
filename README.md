xpath_proto_builder
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yahoo/xpath_proto_builder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yahoo/xpath_proto_builder)

xpath_proto_builder is a library to convert objects (JSON, XML, POJO) into protobuf using xpath notation. It primarily uses [apache's jxpath](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jxpath/users-guide.html) library to query input data and [google's protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) library to populate a protobuf message.

This code is licensed under the BSD license.

How to get the Library
----------------------
The library is hosted on public Maven central and can be used by simply adding the dependency to your pom file.
Add the following lines to your pom file:
   ```xml
   <dependencies>
   ...
   ...
      <dependency>
         <groupId>com.yahoo.xpathproto</groupId>
         <artifactId>xpathproto</artifactId>
         <version>0.1.4</version>
      </dependency>
   ...
   ...
   </dependencies>
   ```
You can get the latest version number from [here](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cxpathproto).

Usage
-----

The xpath_proto_builder requires:
  * An input data source in json, xml or pojo form as suported by the jxpath library.
  * A target Protobuf message.
  * An xpath based configuration used to map input data source fields into protobuf.

A sample code snippet is shown below:

 ```java
    InputStream stream = ObjectTransformerTest.class.getResourceAsStream("/testdata/transformerdata.json");
    Map<String, Object> tdata = mapper.readValue(stream, Map.class);
    
    ProtoBuilder transformer = new ProtoBuilder("/testdata/transformerconfig.json");
    TransformTestProtos.TransformedMessage.Builder builder =
                    (TransformTestProtos.TransformedMessage.Builder) transformer.builder(tdata);
 ```

### Example Configuration and Protobuf

 The code below shows the protobuf and the corresponding transformation configuration:
 
 ```
 package proto.horoscopesnippet;

 option java_package = "com.yahoo.xpathproto.horoscope";
 option java_outer_classname = "HoroscopeSnippetProtos";

 message HoroscopeSnippet {
  required string id = 1;
  required string sign = 2;
  required string label = 3;
  required string title = 4;
  required Summary summary = 5;
  required string link = 6;
  optional string extended_link = 7;
  optional string author = 10;
  required string publish_date = 11;
  optional uint64 ts_update = 12;
 }

 message Summary {
  required string text = 1;
 }
 ```

 The following is an example of a complete configuration file for the protobuf message above
 
 ```json
 {
   "definitions": {
     "rss_transform": {
       "proto": "com.yahoo.xpathproto.horoscope.HoroscopeSnippetProtos$HoroscopeSnippet",
       "transforms": [
         { "path": "rss/channel/item[1]", "definition": "item_transform" }
       ]
     },

     "item_transform": {
       "transforms": [
         { "field": "id" },
         { "field": "sign" },
         { "field": "label" },
         { "field": "title" },
         { "field": "link" },
         { "field": "summary", "path": "description", "definition": "summary_transform" },
         { "field": "extended_link", "path": "link" },
         { "field": "author" },
         { "field": "publish_date", "path": "pubDate" },
         { "field": "ts_update", "handler": "com.yahoo.xpathproto.handler.TimeStampHandler" }
       ]
     },

     "summary_transform": {
       "proto": "com.yahoo.xpathproto.horoscope.HoroscopeSnippetProtos$Summary",
       "transforms": [
         { "field": "text", "path": "." }
       ]
     }

   }
 }
 ```
 
To try it out, you can get the input data from "http://shine.yahoo.com/horoscope/leo/?format=horoscopeRss". This example is also covered as one of the [unit test](/src/test/java/com/yahoo/xpathproto/horoscope/TransformTestHoroscope.java).

Transform Configuration
-----------------------
The library uses an xpath based configuration file __in json format__ to transform input data source fields into the protobuf message. The configuration supports the following type of transformations:

__Pre-requisite__: Each config file should start with a defintion field followed by the description of each definition.

```json
{
  "definitions": {
    "root_transform": {
    ...
    ...
    ...
    }
  }
}
```

1. Field Mapping

 A simple mapping for fields.
 ```json
    { "field": "foo" } // field name is the same as input path
    { "field": "foo", "path": "bar" } // field to simple path mapping
    { "field": "foo", "path": "x/y" } // field to xpath mapping
 ```
The transformation is able to handle protobuf fields that are "repeated".


2. Nested Transformations

 ```json
 {
   "definitions": {
     "root_transform": {
       "proto": "com.yahoo.xpathproto.TransformTestProtos$TransformedMessage",
       "transforms": [
           { "path": "select", "definition": "select_transform" },
       ]
     },
 
     "select_transform": {
       "transforms": [
         { "field": "nested" }
       ]
     }
   }
 }
 ```

3. Variables

 The library also supports defining variables those can be used later in the transform configuration.
 
 ```json
  { "field": "src", "path": "_src", "variable": "var_src" }
  { "field": "var_src", "path": "$var_src" }
 ```

 The user can also use the ProtoBuilder constructor that takes a Context as a parameter to pre-define variable mapping.

4. Custom Handlers

 The library also supports more complex handlers. They need to implement either of [ObjectToFieldHandler](/src/main/java/com/yahoo/xpathproto/ObjectToFieldHandler.java) or [ObjectToProtoHandler](/src/main/java/com/yahoo/xpathproto/ObjectToProtoHandler.java) depending on the requirement.

 For example, the below two handlers implement ObjectToFieldHandler
 1. [RfcTimestampHandler](/src/main/java/com/yahoo/xpathproto/handler/RfcTimestampHandler.java)
 2. [TimeStampHandler](/src/main/java/com/yahoo/xpathproto/handler/TimeStampHandler.java)
 

 There is also a reference class that implements ObjectToProtoHandler [here](/src/test/java/com/yahoo/xpathproto/ImageHandler.java).
